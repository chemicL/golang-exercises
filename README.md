# go-exercises

## About

**go-exercises** is a collection of example code used for teaching Go.

It contains a collection of runnable source files, which depict different language features. I tried to comment every new concept so it's easy to grasp.
Most of the content is inspired by the official Tour of Go available at https://tour.golang.org/ and my own experience writing Go code.
It assumes some experience in programming (preferably an imperative, C family of languages), as I'm not explaining concepts like compilation, type system, programing methodologies, etc.

## Contents

There are three directories available:

- exercises - contains folders for new broader concepts, which contain the runnable code and occasionally tests (the part introducing functions).
- notes - contains a bunch of notes which come without any code examples.
- present - helper methods for printing info to stdout.

## How do I start?

1. Head to [notes/0.prerequisites.txt](./notes/0.prerequisites.txt) and setup your environment. 
2. [notes/1.before-we-start.txt](./notes/1.before-we-start.txt) contains some basic info about Go types and commands.
3. Dive deep in the exercises and be sure to run them and experiment.
4. Also do have a look at [notes/n.final-notes.txt](./notes/n.final-notes.txt) for more references.
