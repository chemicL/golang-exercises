Just some basic info before we start. Use this file for reference at any point in the course.

---
Go version
---

In this course we're using Go 1.10.

---
Go's basic types:
---

bool

string

int  int8  int16  int32  int64
uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr

byte // alias for uint8

rune // alias for int32
     // represents a Unicode code point

float32 float64

complex64 complex128

---
Comparable types:
---

Most Go's types can be compared using == and != operators, excluding function values, slices and maps.
This information will be useful when discussing map keys, which need to be comparable.
